# TEI-Final-Project - Playdate Bingo Simulator
Demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/cmItE6RPfHg

The Playdate is a unique handheld console akin to a modern GameBoy. In addition to a standard 4-way directional pad and two buttons, it also features a crank as an input method. I utilized the crank to create a simulation of a bingo wheel, where you spin the crank to move the bingo balls around and get one as output.

I evaluated my project by playing bingo with friends, using my device to draw balls. Despite bingo itself not being a very interesting game, everybody had fun. Turning the crank and seeing the virtual wheel spin made people feel like they had an actual bingo wheel, which adds some excitement to the game. In the past we have just used an online randomizer to choose balls, and the novelty of having something physical to touch and move made the experience more unique.
